/**
 * This defines the interface for a symmetric <i>one-to-one</i> Object channel.
 * <P>
 * The only methods provided are to obtain the <i>ends</i> of the channel,
 * through which all reading and writing operations are done.
 * Only an appropriate <i>channel-end</i> should be plugged into a process
 * &ndash; not the <i>whole</i> channel.
 * A process may use its external channels in one direction only
 * &ndash; either for <i>writing</i> or <i>reading</i>.
 * </P>
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>One2OneChannelImpl</TT> is an interface for a symmetric one-to-one object channel.
 * Multiple readers or multiple writers are not allowed.
 * <P>
 * Both the reading and writing processes may {@link Alternative <TT>ALT</TT>} on this channel.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * The semantics of the channel is that of CSP &ndash; i.e. it is
 * zero-buffered and fully synchronised.  The reading process must wait
 * for a matching writer and vice-versa.
 * <P>
 * </P>
 * These channels may be constructed by the {@link Channel#one2oneSymmetric()}.
 * Channel poisoning and buffering are not currently supported for these channels.
 * </P>
